# Ved AI – Open Artificial General Intelligence Core

**Ved AI** is building the world’s first open, safe, and human-aligned AGI.
Our mission: democratize general intelligence so it serves all, not just the few.

## Why AGI?

Narrow AI can answer questions. Ved AI’s AGI will reason, plan, create, and learn across domains—language, strategy, healthcare, creativity, and beyond.
Every repo, model, and experiment here is a step toward true artificial general intelligence.
